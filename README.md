# Sequence Learning

This project summarizes the existing studies on sequence data learning. We provide a list of important papers, projects and datasets. We will also implement the famous methods and make a benchmark.

## Applications

- [2-dimensional data](2Ddata.md): speech, music, and time-series.
- [Natural language processing](NLP.md): QA, NER, abstract generation, image captioning.
- [Contextual interactions](context.md): QA, autopilot, contextual recommendations and searching.
- [Computer-vision related](cv.md): videos, image captioning.
